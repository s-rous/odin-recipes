    <h2>Turkish Delight</h2>
    <p>This dessert is slightly exotic and is known by many people who have read the book 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe'. This would do well for a tea party, a holiday party, or even if you just wanted to surprise someone.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
            <li>½ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons orange zest</li>
            <li>3 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped pistachio nuts</li>
            <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
            <p>Bring 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Cook, stirring frequently, until the temperature reaches 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) on a candy thermometer. Set aside and keep hot.</p>
            <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
            <p>Stir together orange juice and orange zest, sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in 1/2 cup cold water, then stir into hot syrup. Place over medium-low heat, and simmer, stirring gently, until very thick.</p>
            <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
            <p>Remove syrup from heat, stir in orange juice mixture, vanilla, and pistachios. Sprinkle a 8x8-inch pan generously with confectioners' sugar. Pour the Turkish delight into the pan, and let cool in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until set, 3 to 4 hours.</p>
            <strong><li>Step 4</li></strong>
            <p>When cool, sprinkle the top with another thick layer of powdered sugar. Cut into 1-inch squares, and dredge each well with confectioners' sugar. Store at room temperature in an airtight container.</p>
